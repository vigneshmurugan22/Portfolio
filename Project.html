           <dd>Construction of the gear system to research the reduced weight and stress distribution of casting metal and carbon fibre. In a hydraulic power transfer device in industrial spinning machines, gearing is one of the most important elements. Given their high level of certainty and controllability, in future devices, gears might dominate as perhaps the most powerful ways of sending electricity. Furthermore, the growing change in the sector to companies like car manufacturing and office automation devices from key sectors like naval boats would entail the refined use of equipment technologies. Model the spur gear model using modelling techniques. To examine the effects study on casting iron and infrastructure projects. For casting structural steel items, displacement charging should really be examined. It is important to compare and evaluate the composite gear with the current cast steel gear.</dd>
